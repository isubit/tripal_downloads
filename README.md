# tripal_downloads
Provides a content type for downloadable files. Individual downloads can optionally be exposed as JBrowse tracks through [Tripal JBrowse API](https://github.com/isubit/tripal_jbrowse_api).

## Install

Install the module like a normal Drupal module. Then, if you want the files to be accessible from a JBrowse instance on a different server, create a .htaccess file in your site's files/download folder with the following:
```
# This Apache .htaccess file is generated by JBrowse (GenomeDB) for
# allowing cross-origin requests as defined by the Cross-Origin
# Resource Sharing working draft from the W3C
# (http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).  In order for Apache to pay attention
# to this, it must have mod_headers enabled, and its AllowOverride
# configuration directive must allow FileInfo overrides.
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header onsuccess set Access-Control-Allow-Origin *
    Header onsuccess set Access-Control-Allow-Headers Origin,X-Requested-With,Content-Type,Accept,Range
</IfModule>
```
